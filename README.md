# Routty Game
A short project to create a fun interactive demo of how Routty helps a business in connecting to different channels.

The game will work similar to mini-metro, where the player has to guide invoices to through the correct format (shape) and channel (color) to the customer (color+shape).

Without Routty this quickly becomes difficult and like a spaghetti, but after failing the player will get "Routy" as a hub, which will automatically assign the correct color + shape before sending to the customer.
